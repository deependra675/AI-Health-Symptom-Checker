# AI Health Symptom Checker

An interactive AI-powered healthcare assistant built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.

This application predicts possible diseases based on user-selected symptoms and provides:
- disease descriptions
- precaution recommendations
- confidence analysis
- interactive medical dashboard UI

---

# Features

## Disease Prediction
Predicts possible diseases using a trained Machine Learning model.

## Symptom-Based Analysis
Users can select multiple symptoms from an interactive sidebar.

## Disease Description
Displays medical information related to the predicted disease.

## Precaution Suggestions
Provides basic health precautions and safety recommendations.

## Confidence Visualization
Shows top disease probabilities using interactive charts.

## Modern Interactive UI
Built with Streamlit using:
- tabs layout
- animated loading
- responsive dashboard
- card-style interface

# Machine Learning Workflow

## Dataset
The model was trained using a symptom-disease dataset where:
- symptoms are input features
- disease is the target label

---

## Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## Training Steps
1. Data cleaning
2. Symptom encoding
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Model serialization using Joblib

---

# Preprocessing Files

## `prepare_description.py`
Processes disease descriptions into a fast dictionary lookup system.

## `prepare_precaution.py`
Processes precaution data and stores it in serialized format.

---

# User Interface

The UI includes:
- sidebar symptom selection
- modern card layout
- tab-based navigation
- prediction confidence chart
- smooth loading animation
